This is my "Getting to Know me Enhanced" project. There isn't really a set layout for this to be replicated, 
but most CSS and Java Script needed can be found on w3schools.com. The code here is my original use, but may
was infulenced from w3schools.com.
That is where I learned to code the majority of this project.
The code for the rainbow color on my name was used from stackoverflow.com
